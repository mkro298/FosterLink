In the foster care system, many children endure challenging circumstances, including parental abuse, neglect, or the instability caused by divorce. These children often experience frequent transitions between foster homes, leading to a lack of stability and a sense of disconnection. Upon reaching the age of 18, many of them find themselves without support, feeling misunderstood, neglected and in need of guidance as they transition to adulthood.
Recognizing this critical need, we have developed the Fosterlink Website, designed to provide comprehensive support and resources for foster care children. We aim to collaborate with organizations such as Casey Family Programs to integrate this app into their programs, thereby extending much-needed assistance to the children in their care. Conversations with social workers have highlighted a significant gap in resources available directly to foster children, as opposed to foster parents. Our project seeks to bridge this gap by creating a safe and supportive environment for foster kids aged 18 and above. While researching this idea further, we discovered that there are no viable competitors in the market. The existing apps are primarily focused on supporting foster parents. However, after speaking with alumni from the foster care system, they expressed strong belief in the potential benefits of this app. This feedback reinforces our conviction that this website will be highly valuable.
The web app aims to support foster kids aged 18 and above who have aged out of the foster care system. It provides essential resources and guidance for education, college applications, and community building, helping them transition smoothly into adulthood and achieve their educational and personal goals.
The Foster link Website includes the following key features:
Tutoring/ Mentoring Services: Providing a tool to find affordable tutors or mentors based on location and subject needs, ensuring academic support is accessible.
Scholarship: Offering a database of scholarships filtered by criteria such as low income and race/ethnicity, making financial aid more attainable.
Both of these will fall under a resource button:
Educational Resources: Linking to valuable educational websites to support continuous learning and development.
Mental Health Resources: Providing access to mental health resources and support services to promote well-being.

Community: Featuring a chat service to foster a sense of community and allow users to connect, share experiences, and support one another.
Through this project, we aim to empower foster care children by providing them with the tools and resources they need to thrive. By creating a supportive community and offering comprehensive educational and career planning assistance, the Foster link Website seeks to make a meaningful difference in the lives of these young individuals.
